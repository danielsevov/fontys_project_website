# User stories
## Visitors
### Boris
	As a visitor, I want to easily browse
	teasers, play them and register so that
	I can acknowledge the capabilities of this app. 
## Listener
### Ted 
	As a listener, I want to browse
	songs in my library and make playlists 
	so that I can listen to my favorite
	music. Because of limited storage capacity
	Ted likes to download songs to listen to them offline,
	but he needs to delete them soon again
### David
	As a listener, I want to browse
	songs, read info of a song, follow artists, receive recommendations and 
	read and write reviews so that I can find the right music and
	stay up to date with new trends in
	music. I also like to share new songs with my friends or get
	new songs from them
### Lindsey 
	As a listener, I want to have an
	automatically updated playlist and
	receive recommendations so that I
	never waste time looking for
	something to listen to. 

## Composer
### Karl 
	As a composer, I want to
	upload songs and organize
	albums and set their prices
	individually so that I can make
	a decent profit. I want to see my statistics and analytics
	as well as advertise my music in order to have good control
	over my music career.
### Rose 
	As a composer, I want to upload music,
	read reviews from my fans
	so that I can improve my music and
	reach a wider audience. I want to be able to 
	browse through the profiles and work of other creators like me
	so I can drain inspiration and stay up to date with the trends.
	Other than that, sometimes there are typos so I love having the option to edit info of a song.
### Jake
	As a composer, I want to upload
	music to leave a footprint on the
	industry so that I can help others with
	their music while improving upon myself
