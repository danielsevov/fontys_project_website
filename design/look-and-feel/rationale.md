**Rationale for our moodboard selection**

When we were looking at our individual moodboard results we noticed that what we all have in common was the rectangular form of the images we imported, 
as well as the spacing we had left between them. We decided that for the final moodboard we want to keep this style.

For the font we saw a few different options but we realized we are looking for something not too basic and straight but also not too playful.
What Timo had chosen for his board - Dosis Extra Bold, was the perfect fit. Unique, elegant but not too distracting. We decided to work with it.

When we were choosing the colors we decided to test them on an example page we made. We saw that Ervin's dark background with the light grey/brown font color was already giving our page
a more interesting look. Combined with the other four filling colors we felt the page was complete and not missing any special coloration, so we decided to use this color theme.

In our individual moodboards we had included many different photos but we noticed that most of us included some sort of musical instrument. We decided to use instruments to give our
final moodboard an easy to recognise musical look. The images Ervin had picked were matching the color theme we had agreed on and were cropped and adjusted to give the moodboard a bit more
detailed and antisymetric look so we decided to use them for the final version.

After creating the final version of the moodboard we all shared our thoughts and after a few quick adjustments we had the finalized version which we all think looks perfect!
